Conclusion:

The website pre-ownedplus.co.za is technically active, with standard WordPress infrastructure, functional SSL, and email. However, multiple indicators — extremely new domain, hidden registrant, and lack of verifiable company details — suggest a high risk of scam.
While some technical security aspects are acceptable, anyone considering business or financial transactions with this site should perform rigorous due diligence before proceeding.
